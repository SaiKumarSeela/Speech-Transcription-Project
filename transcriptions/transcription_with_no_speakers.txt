Let's start off by talking about your daily routine. Tell me about your daily routine. Okay, well I wake up around 8 a.m. Every morning it's like clockwork and I brush my teeth, I wash my face, breakfast, and then I get in my car and I drive to work. And yeah, that's basically it. I come back home and fix myself up some dinner and watch some Netflix, very average, mundane. How has your daily routine changed since you were a child? Not much, except I go to work now instead of school. But I get a lot of free time over the weekends, so I get to do the things I like to do such as meditation and writing. I love journaling. I'd love to put out some novels one day. I always thought that I would retire to the countryside in my old age with my animals and write books. So yeah, so writing, yoga, what else do I do on the weekends? Oh, I want to try horse riding as well. Is your daily routine different at the weekend compared to during the week? Yes, 100%. So the weekdays are for work, mainly, being productive, paying the bills, and the weekends I get to do whatever I want to do. So I really treasure and enjoy my weekends. Let's talk now about dreams. Do you dream much at night? I do dreams sometimes, but not very often. And when I do dream, I don't tend to remember my dreams. Do you think we can learn anything from dreams? I think so. I think there's lots of repressed emotions and stress that come out during our dreams that perhaps we haven't addressed in real life. So yes, I believe we can learn quite a lot and I suppose some people can even, you know, predict the future through dreams or images that they see.
