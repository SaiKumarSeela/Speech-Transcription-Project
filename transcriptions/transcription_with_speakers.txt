Speaker 1: Now let's talk about email. What kind of emails do you receive about your work?
Speaker 2: I receive a lot of emails from my higher ups. So my manager, people from other departments as well, usually following up for things, um, or scheduling meetings. Um, just a lot of work that needs to be done and reminders to please do this work.
Speaker 1: So do you normally reply to emails as soon as you receive them?
Speaker 2: Oh, no. Um, I don't because I feel like there's no point in replying if the work hasn't been done. So let's say we're supposed to schedule a meeting and something needs to be done. I'd much prefer to get that thing done and then respond by saying, okay, here it is. Here's the file that you, um, that you requested or that you asked for. And, um, yeah, instead of, you know, uh, random sort of hello, well received. Thank you.
Speaker 1: Are you happy to receive emails that are advertising things?
Speaker 2: No, I don't think anyone would be. Unless it's for a brand that I follow or that I like, unless they're having a sale.
