Speaker,Summary
Speaker 1,Let's start off by talking about your daily routine. How has your daily routine changed since you were a child? Is your daily routine different at the weekend compared to during the week? Let's talk now about dreams. Do you dream much at night? Do you think we can learn anything from dreams?
Speaker 2,"I wake up at 8 a.m. daily, brush my teeth, wash my face, have breakfast, and drive to work. My average day consists of work, dinner, and Netflix. On weekends, I have free time to engage in activities I enjoy, such as meditation, writing, and journaling. I'd like to publish novels one day and retire to the countryside where I can write and be with animals. I also want to try horse riding.

I view weekdays as for work, productivity, and paying bills, while weekends are for personal activities. I don't often recall my dreams, but I believe dreams can reveal repressed emotions and stress. Some people may even use dreams to predict the future or gain insight."
